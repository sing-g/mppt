MPPT Smart solar charge controller
Using the MPPT technology the smart solar charge controller takes in the optimum power from the solar panels and feeds it to the battery.
MPPT stands for maximum power point tracking, in layman terms, we are continuously looking for a sweet spot between voltage and current output of solar panel or object of interest to extract maximum power output.
This whole project parameters like battery temp, battery charge status, solar power output, etc have been displayed on a 16x2 LCD display panel.
The microcontroller used to oversee the whole project and carry out the necessary calculations is Arduino nano.
The project is self-sufficient and doesn't need any external power source.
